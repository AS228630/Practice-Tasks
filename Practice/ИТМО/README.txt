 My friend [@capicua_](https://twitter.com/capicua_) sent me a Christmas postcard. She took me by surprise. I wasn't expecting anything, there was ages from the last time I received even a letter.
I'm not good with that sort of thing (writing letters/greeting postcards) and, even so, it won't take her by surprise, so, in exchange for her kindness, I thought about something else that I could do for her, instead of a traditional postcard reply.

She loves cats, so I came out with this «simple» pure CSS cat/digital new year greeting card :þ.

**Note**: it works slightly better on Firefox.

Hope you like it, [@capicua_](https://twitter.com/capicua_). It's «simple», but it was made with much love <3.

Hugs (~\*3\*)~.
